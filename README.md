# KantoxCart

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
  * Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) and test the cart functionality from your browser
  * The cart logic is written in `lib/kantox_cart/cart.ex`
  * Or run `mix.test` to test the functionality by running the testcases written in `test/kantox_cart/cart_test.exs`
